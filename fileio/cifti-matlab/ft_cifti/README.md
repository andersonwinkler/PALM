MATLAB code for reading and writing CIFTI files
===============================================

NOTE:  The code available in this directory has known behaviors that are problematic when using fMRI CIFTI data processed with HCP templates.  For fMRI CIFTI data, we recommend and provide support for using the code in the root of this repository, or legacy ciftiopen/ciftisave/ciftisavereset (available at https://wiki.humanconnectome.org/display/PublicData/HCP+Users+FAQ, FAQ #2, option II).

This repository contains a subset of the MATLAB code from the FieldTrip and
the SPM toolboxes. It should allow MATLAB users and developers to integrate
the CIFTI file format in their analysis pipelines, using the data and tools
of the Human Connectome Project (HCP).

See http://www.humanconnectome.org for details on the HCP.

See http://www.nitrc.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=1955 for details on CIFTI.
